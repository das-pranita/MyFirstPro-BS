Old Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

Overview -
This project aims to predict the prices of old cars using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains information about various old cars, including their specifications and selling prices. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the selling price of a used car based on its attributes.

Dataset -
The dataset used in this project consists of the following attributes:

Name: Name of the car model

Year: Year of manufacture

Selling Price: Price at which the car was sold

Kilometers Driven: Total kilometers driven by the car

Fuel: Type of fuel used by the car (e.g., Petrol, Diesel)

Seller Type: Type of seller (e.g., Individual, Dealer)

Transmission: Type of transmission (e.g., Manual, Automatic)

Owner: Number of previous owners

Data Preprocessing-

Handling Missing Values: Missing values in the dataset were addressed through imputation or removal, ensuring the integrity of the data.

Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical variables were encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding to convert them into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Feature Engineering-

Age of Car: A new feature representing the age of each car was created by subtracting the manufacturing year from the current year.

Visualization of Data Distribution-

Visualizations of both numerical and categorical features were generated to gain insights into the distribution and relationships within the dataset. These visualizations provide valuable insights into the characteristics of the data.

Code Highlights-

Snippets of code showcasing data preprocessing, feature engineering and visualization techniques were included for reference and transparency.

Next Steps-

Explore advanced machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Regression or Gradient Boosting Regression to improve prediction accuracy.

Conduct feature selection techniques to identify the most influential attributes affecting old car prices.

Evaluate model performance using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model parameters.

Consider deploying the trained model into production to provide real-time predictions for stakeholders in the automotive market.
